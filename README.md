# Excel report generation using apache poi and jxls  

## Dependencies  
Struggled to make apache poi libs work with jxls 2.0 , when moved from java 8 to java 17
Although dependency upgration was easy to solve . Main issue was to migrate templates 
* poi : 3.17 -> 4.1.2
* jxls : 1 -> 2.10

  ## jxls template migration from 1.x to 2.x
This is the key part .
Please refer to [Guide] (https://github.com/tanmaypatil/excel-templating/blob/main/excelgen/JXLS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
